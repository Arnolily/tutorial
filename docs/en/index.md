# Introduction

Hello students, this is a tutorial for the UESTC3036 course (AI & ML). In this tutorial, we will guide you through installing the programming tools needed for Lab 3 and Lab 4.

Before you start, please read the following and choose the installation method that works best for you:

## Path 1: Simple and Direct (Recommended for students who want to get started quickly)

-   **Choose**: [Python and Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide](./Python%20and%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20安装指南.md)
-   **Features**: Simple installation with only one global Python environment. Good for students whose course tasks are not complex and who don't want to deal with environment setups.
-   **Downsides**: It can be difficult to manage if you need to work on different projects in the future or if you run into library version conflicts.

## Path 2: Professional and Efficient (Recommended for students who want to learn more deeply)

-   **Choose**: [Anaconda and VSCode Installation Guide](./Optional.md)
-   **Features**: Use Anaconda to create independent virtual environments. This gives each project a clean, isolated space and completely solves dependency conflicts. Using it with VSCode gives you the best coding and debugging experience.
-   **Downsides**: The initial setup is a bit more complex, and you need to understand the concept of "environments."

## Our Recommendation

If you're not sure which one to choose, **we recommend starting with Path 1**. Getting started is always the hardest part, so there's no need to be too strict with yourself at the beginning. Path 2 won't necessarily make the lab content any easier. If you run into environment problems later on, or if you get tired of the simple user interface, you can always switch to Path 2.

> 💡 **Tip**: The two paths are **not mutually exclusive**. You can certainly start with Path 1 and then move to Path 2 later.
